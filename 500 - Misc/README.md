# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

[The Zen of Python, Explained][]

## [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code]
[PEP 8 — the Style Guide for Python Code (for humans)][]

> One of Guido’s key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written.
> The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code
> and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says,
> “Readability counts”.
>
> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important.
> Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module
> or function is the most important.
>
> However, know when to be inconsistent—sometimes style guide recommendations
> just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment.
> Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask!
>
> In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP!

### What is Lint?
> In computer programming lint or lint-like tools performing static analysis of
> source code checking for symantec discrepancies.
> 
> “Linting” means running a basic quality tool against your code.
> The tool will check your code syntax and provide instructions on how to clean it.

Python Lint tools:
* [flake8]
* [pylint]
